## Welcome
Given the 5 CSV files which have information about happiness score in different countries, train a regression machine learning model to predict the happiness score.

Throughout this process, specific technologies were used including:

- _Python_ <img src="https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/128/3098/3098090.png" alt="Python" width="21px" height="21px"> 

- _Jupyter Notebook_  <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/Jupyter_logo.svg/883px-Jupyter_logo.svg.png" alt="Jupyer" width="21px" height="21px">

- _PostgreSQL_ as the relational database management system (this was chosen by personal preference). <img src="https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/128/5968/5968342.png" alt="Postgres" width="21px" height="21px">

- _Apache Kafka_  <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/Apache_kafka.svg/1200px-Apache_kafka.svg.png" width="21px" height="25px">

## Objectives

- **Data Analysis and Preparation (EDA and ETL)**: Performed exploratory data analysis and prepared the dataset for modeling processes by cleaning, preprocessing, and selecting the most relevant features.

- **Regression Model Development**: Built a regression model using a 70% training and 30% testing data split, optimizing its performance to obtain accurate results.

- **Data Streaming Implementation with Kafka**: Designed a data streaming architecture using Kafka, allowing real-time processing of data from the EDA and ETL stages for predictive modeling.

- **Prediction and Results Storage**: Used the trained model to generate real-time happiness score predictions and stored those predictions along with associated features in a database.
